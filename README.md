ANALYSE YOUTUBE CHANNELS: Who is the most productive productivity-YouTubers?


My project is inspired by Ms.Thu Vu's project about crawling data from YouTube API: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D56_Cx36oGY&t=1081s.

I analyze the top 6 youtube channels that create content about my favorite topic - productivity:

    * Ali Abdaal
    * Mat D'Avella
    * Better Ideas
    * Nathaniel Drew
    * Kharma Medic
    * Mariana Vieira
After using Python to get data from YouTube API, I start visualizing the data in PowerBI to answer my curiousity: 
Who is the most productive productivity-YouTubers? 

To answer my question, I focus on analysing three main aspects:

    * Who attract the most views?
    * Who is the most disciplined?
    * Who has the most engaging content? 
Among these 6 youtubers, Ali Abdaal dominates both in terms of the number of subscribers and the total number of views, 
while Better Ideas has the most attractive content that gain the highest average views per video. 

To further understand two youtube channels. I dig deeper into their videos's duration, title, and words on the titles. 
Better Ideas is consistent in generating videos with a length in the range of 8-10 minutes and has titles with 30-40 words. 
When comparing the most frequent words used in Ali and Better Ideas' channels, Ali covers a wide variety of topics, while Better Ideas has a narrower focus. 
It is reasonable that the word "How" appears most in both channels, as they tend to create videos about explaining or giving guidance related to enhancing productivity. 

My report is available as a PDF attachment. Please refer to the attachment for more details.
